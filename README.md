# Natural-Domain-Specific-Speech-Synthesis-Framework
We have made a system which can be used by developers of any software application using audio or text dialogues in any domain.
We are creating variations in one sentence so that the same dialogue can be played/used many times without repetition and 
thus it will look natural. Template sentences are game dialogues, adjectives and adverbs only will be replaced.
We have made one library and two tools which will be built upon the library. Library is actually be composed of a whole front
end compiler for specific English Language grammar (some cases of past indefinite), replacing and smoothing algorithms. 
One tool is Audio Dictionary which records, take information and fill the databank of replaceable words. 
The Second tool is Speech Template Editor. It enters Template Sentences, let the user edit them according to his need,
mark the waveform and choose the replaceable words from the suggestions. 
The database filled by both these tools is used by the user in his project along with our library
